## Open Pioneer

Open Pioneer is an initiative for collaborative development of technologies and components for next generation geospatial information infrastructures and solutions. The following projects are part of the initiative.

### Open Pioneer Trails

Open Pioneer Trails is an open framework for developing custom web based GeoIT client applications using modern tooling and providing an outstanding developer experience. Trails is available for free on Github as open-source software. The project is maintained by [con terra](https://www.conterra.de/) and [52°North](https://52north.org/). Contributions are welcome!

To create solutions that use OpenLayers as a mapping library, common base packages are provided in the repository [trails-openlayers-base-packages](https://github.com/open-pioneer/trails-openlayers-base-packages).
